# H1 Description portfolio
This portfolio is one of many websites I have created, although it was a bit difficult because you are talking about yourself. This portfolio is just a small proof of my skills which I am confident about. The portfolio is a small showcase for some of my previous projects and created, and a way for people who are interested in my set of skills to contact me for different kind of projects.
## H2 challenges faces 
 I have faced many small challenges like the images optimisation I tried different methods like the picture entrance code and the direct input but what worked at last is creating different sizes of the picture and making them responsive with each screen size, and with the CSS validation I had a code that didn’t want to be fix that costed me to make it all over again. But the biggest problem I faced during making my portfolio is that I lost all my files after I couldn’t find the folder containing them and I was almost halfway done with it, but I mad it again from scratch.
### H3 what I have learned
What I have learned from this project that there is a lot of methods to do a task or to create a component.
